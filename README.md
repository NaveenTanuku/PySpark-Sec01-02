    #Big Data Story
    So far I have been in charge of completing and turning in all team assignments and communicating with my team with whatever project or GitHub related questions they may have. My team uses Microsoft Teams to discuss problems and we chose a unique name for our package as a group. I have completed most of the project and believe I have all the code for Job 1 and 2 done.
